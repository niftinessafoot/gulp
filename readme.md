# gulpfile
Build files for my dev environments.

# setup
## bash script
In `.bash_profile`, add the following function:
```bash
serve(){
    gulp ${2} --gulpfile ~/Projects/gulp/gulpfile.js --cwd ${1:-.}
}
```
This assumes two things:

  * gulp is installed globally
  * `~/Projects/gulp/gulpfile.js` is the gulpfile to run.

## directory structure
Script assumes this directory structure:
```
project
 |-- .git
 |-- src
 |    |-- scss
 |    |-- js
 |    |-- i
 |    |-- inc
 |-- dist
```
The only important directory is `src`, as `dist` will create itself if need be. Version control wherever you want.

# running
Assuming youâ€™ve added the bash function and configured gulp, you can now run `serve` from the project root. Gulp will watch `src` and compile to `dist`.
